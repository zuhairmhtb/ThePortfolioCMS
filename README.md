# My Portfolio - The Frontend Experience (Wordpress CMS)

This repository contains the application that will act as the Rest API to the frontend application (Angular). I have used Wordpress as the CMS because it provides a rich editor to create posts like documentations. To run the application - just run the docker compose file!
